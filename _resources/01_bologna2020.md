## XML-RELATED LANGUAGES - XPATH, XSLT, and XQUERY

In this laboratory I will teach *XML related languages* and some of their tools. Students and researchers working in DH are often working with XML. The aim of those classes is to give an overview of best practices and gather together a few online resources.  

## **Course materials**

Before starting, just make sure you have your editor downloaded and ready to use it. Check out at the bottom of the page.

### **What are we going to achieve?**

The practical part of this laboratory aims at trasforming with XSLT and XQUERY this XML file: [download here](/public/resources/Frankenstein-v1c5-transcription.xml) to this HTML visualisation: [download here](/public/resources/bologna.html).

Please download the XML file before starting the laboratory.
