"Magica Levantina (ML)" aims at the edition of mainly unpublished Greek magical texts from towns in the Levant in the late Roman Imperial and early Byzantine periods. Most of the texts are curses inscribed on sheets of lead but also some protective charms inscribed on sheets of gold and silver. Tecnhical issues: the software was built with ExistDB, written in Xquery and Xslt (and some js). Images were digitised in RTI (Reflectance Transformation Imaging). In order, to support the encoding of the transcriptions and translations, an editor was built within the software.  It was such a fun working on this project!\\ The repository is still private but if you are curious about some of the components I made just drop me an email.
