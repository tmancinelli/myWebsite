<h3>Project Guideline</h3>

<p>The final project will be a representation of digital scholarly 
    edition and/or distant reading methods. This will include:</p>
<p>A document where you describe the theoretical assumptions you made 
    and the structure of your project. 
    Make sure you clarify your research questions in this document, 
    such as through a section entitled, “My research question”. Make sure you answer 
    the following questions: what message would you expect to deliver? 
    How will you organise your content? Does your model fit with your research 
    question?</p>
    <br>
    <p>A webpage on your GitHub repository with a structure and 
        a map of content that follows the idea described in the document - 
        Examples: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp </p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>If you use XSLT or Xquery:</strong></p>
    <p>- The script in GitHub</p>
    <br>

    <p>- A manifest for the description of the images, also on the basis of the model 
        indicated.</p>

    <p>If you are working together with other 
        colleagues, we would like to have a clear acknowledgement of 
        your work throughout ‘comments’ you might use for any computer 
        language and also in the documentation or in a possible ‘about’ on 
        the Website.</p>
