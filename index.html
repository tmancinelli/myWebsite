<h3>Welcome to my website!</h3>
<p>You will find some information about myself and some links to resourses, tools, and projects I have been working on. However, this website does not contain at present everything about my work: it is still a work-in-progress.</p>

I am always interested in working on interdisciplinary projects and explore several methods in computer science. <br/>I has been involved in anti-racist and feminist activism for many years, developing a interests on construction of online identities. </p>
